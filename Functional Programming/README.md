### Recursive Components

A recursive function is calling itself for n number of times until it reaches a base case. React components are also functions, so what if we call a react component from itself? We have a recursive component!

### Component Composition

You have seen how multiple functions can be composed together to achieve something bigger. The same applies to HTML elements and beyond to React components too.
Simply put, component composition means building more complex components on top of simpler ones.

### Partially Applied Components

Partial application is when you only pass a subset of a function's arguments. This also can be applied to components in React.
