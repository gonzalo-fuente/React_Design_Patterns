# Custom Hooks

A custom hook allows you to extract some components logic into a reusable function.

A custom hook is a Javascript function that starts with use and can call other hooks. Components and hooks are just functions, so we are really not creating any new concepts here. We are just refactoring our code into another function to make it reusable.
