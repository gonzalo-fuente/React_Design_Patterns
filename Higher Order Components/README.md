# Higher Order Components

A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. A higher-order component (HOC) is the advanced technique in React.js for reusing a component logic. Higher-Order Components are not part of the React API. They are the pattern that emerges from Reactâ€™s compositional nature. The component transforms props into UI, and a higher-order component converts a component into another component.
